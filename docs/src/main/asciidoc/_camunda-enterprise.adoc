[[camunda-enterprise]]
== Using camunda enterprise

With 2.0.0 some enhancements for usage of camunda-spring-boot-starter and
the camunda enterprise webapp.

Have a look at the example-webapp-ee https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-spring-boot-starter/tree/master/examples/example-webapp-ee.

To enable the project, run maven with the `-Penterprise` flag.

If using enterprise, you can also use the `camunda.bpm.license-file` property to provide a license file
that is inserted on application start. Or copy your license file under the name `camunda-license.txt`
 to your `src/main/resources`.

Attention: due to the nature of the maven build plugin, using the enterprise edition webjar is currently not supported if you use gradle!
