== Using camunda enterprise

With 2.0.0 some enhancements for usage of camunda-spring-boot-starter and
the camunda enterprise webapp.

If using enterprise, you can also use the `camunda.bpm.license-file` property to provide a license file
that is inserted on application start. Or copy your license file under the name `camunda-license.txt`
 to your `src/main/resources`.
